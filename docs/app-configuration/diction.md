# Diction

Diction allows you to customize what an entity will be called throughout the application by provisioning the singular and plural labels.

For example, say an entity is labeled `faqs` in the database but you want it to be labeled `Frequently Asked Questions` on the app, Diction would allow you to specify that

Also since the convention for table names is to use the plural form, having a `Singular` field allows you to specify the singular diction and vice-versa
