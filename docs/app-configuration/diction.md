# Diction

Diction allows you to customize what an entity will be called throughout the application by providing the `singular` and `plural` form.

For example, say an entity is labeled `faqs` in the database and shows as `Faqs` in the UI but you want it to be labeled `Frequently Asked Questions` on the app, updating the diction form `Plural` field would allow you to update the application.

Since the convention for table names is to use the plural form, then filling the `Singular` field allows you to specify the singular diction.
