# Views

Views enables you to implement views like this

![Tab Tables](./img/table-tabs.png)

You simply add all the tabs you want with the `Add new tab` button

For each tab, you will be able to set the title of the tab and customize the query for that tab along with the default sorting you desire

If you set just one tab then that tab will not show in the UI but the settings for that one tab will be implemented.

:::info
 Having just one tab is the way to modify the default query for your table.
