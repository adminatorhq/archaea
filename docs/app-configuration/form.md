# Form
Forms are complex, They are the core of the business requirement and we believe giving you a programming API will be the best to satisfy the deepest requirement as opposed to making things visual and blocking you when your requirement gets too complex. 

As you will expect you will need some Javascript knowledge to proceed in this section

There are three forms that we use to achieve this

## Field State
TODO

## Before Submit
TODO
// Here, you get to modify your form just before submit so that you add or remove fields based on requirements

## After Submit
TODO Here, you get to run any action just after the action is submitted
synced DB validations
