# System Profile

Hadmean rolls out its authentication and authorization but sometimes you want to import the details of your user from other systems, usually their IDs etc.

System Profile is how you pass that information to Hadmean

You will just have to paste in that information and save it and it will be regurgitated to you when you need it, Like appending the `userId` of who is updating a user account balance to the form, etc or disable a button if the user has some certain properties

The field is optional and it takes in a JSON value
