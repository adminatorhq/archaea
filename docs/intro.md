# Introduction

Hadmean is a open-source internal tool generator that build itself based on your database schema and your configurations. It is all batteries included and extremely customizable


## What

Building admin interface is a mostly a chore for developers and we tend to find the easiest way to build them and sometimes delegating it to the juniors of the teams

Hadmean sets up you admin interface literally how fast you can type you DB credentials and `npx hadmean@latest`

It a no-code tool which gives you the reigns when your requirement are very unique so it also highly customization 

# Why
There are plenty admin project out there both Free and Fremium/Paid

The free and good ones are usually tied to a framework and all your experience with it are useless when you hop to your next shiny language. They are usually not asthetically pleasing and always require a developer to make any change

The Fremium/Paid ones are usually good but very restricted as the free version are usually demo plans for you to get a taste of what they can do and you will have to get to the paywall to get to be usable for your day to day

# How

We believe you database information should be the golden truth of your application, As such we read your database relations, tables constraints, fields constraint, enums etc and implemented all that information in the UI without an input from you

Most admin generators pride themselves on their powerful drag and drop system which is actually great as it allows for great customization but it makes developers have an extra place to update business requirement and work to keep them in sync

Hadmean might get to a drag-and-drop system in the future but for now we want to ride this database idealogy for as long as we can
