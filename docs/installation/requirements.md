# Requirements

You will be needing the following few things to run Hadmean
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- A Terminal to run some commands
- Desktop browser of your choice
- The database you want to interface

A well designed database is not compulsory but it is nice to have. This will make your life easier as you will get a lot of functionality and have to do less setup 

Having a well designed schema entails
 - Having your `user_id` joined correctly to `users` table
 - Having enums when appropraite as opposed to just plain text
 - Having non-nullable columns when needed
 - Having length for text fields
 - Using boolean fields instead of "YES/NO"
 - Having a primary field for every table

If all of these sound ridicoulous to you, then Hadmean was built for you.
